## Introduction

Automatic icon and splash screen resizing tool. Helpful for quickly generating image assets for **Angular**/**Ionic**/**Capacitor**/**Cordova**/**PhoneGap** apps, PWAs, and general use.

It automatically resizes and copies your `icon.png` and `splash.png` files to the platform-dedicated directories.

---

## Installation

To install the `image-res-generator` globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g image-res-generator
```

This will make the `irgen` command available globally on your system.

### Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify that the `irgen` command is available by running:

```bash
irgen --version
```

If the command is not recognized, make sure that the global npm binary path is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

---

## Usage

### Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install the Tool**:
    Make sure you've installed `image-res-generator` globally by running the command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g image-res-generator
    ```

2. **Prepare Your Images**:
    Place your `icon.png` and `splash.png` files in the `resources/` directory at the root of your project. These images should be at least (1024px x 1024px) for icons and (2732px x 2732px) for splash screens.

    **Example Directory Structure**:
    ```
    resources/
    â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png
    â””â”€â”€ splash.png
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use `SVG` vector images:

    ```
    resources/
    â”œâ”€â”€ icon.svg
    â””â”€â”€ splash.svg
    ```

3. **Generate Resized Images**:
    Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    irgen
    ```

    This command will resize and copy your images to the appropriate directories for each platform.

4. **Customize the Output**:
    If you want to customize the output or process only specific platforms, you can use the available options. For example, to generate resources only for Android and iOS, run:

    ```bash
    irgen -p android,ios
    ```

    Refer to the [Options](#options) section below for more details.

5. **Verify the Output**:
    After running the command, verify that the generated images are placed correctly in the platform-specific directories.

### Required Files

Add your `icon` and `splash` files to the 'resources' folder under the root of your project. Make sure they are at least (1024px x 1024px) for icons and (2732px x 2732px) for splash images. 

```
resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png
â””â”€â”€ splash.png
```

**Update**: You could now use `SVG` vector images for the same ðŸŽ‰. 

```
resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ icon.svg
â””â”€â”€ splash.svg
```
While creating a base splash image, make sure that the splash screen's artwork roughly fits/covers a square (1200x1200) at the center of the image (2732x2732).

You can use this [template](https://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd) provided by the Ionic team for easier splash creation.

### Command Line

```bash
image-res-generator
```
or

```bash
irgen
```

**ATTENTION:** while preserving source files, it overwrites previous output if any.

### Options

```bash
-V, --version               output the version number
-i, --icon [optional]       optional icon file path
                            (default: ./resources/icon.png)
-s, --splash [optional]     optional splash file path
                            (default: ./resources/splash.png)
-p, --platforms [optional]  optional platform token comma separated list
                            available tokens: android, ios, windows, blackberry10, pwa
                            (default: all platforms processed)
-o, --outputdir [optional]  optional output directory
                            (default: ./resources/)
-I, --makeicon [optional]   option to process icon files only
-S, --makesplash [optional] option to process splash files only
-c, --crop[optional]        option to crop images, instead of the default 'resize' strategy. 
-h, --help                  output usage information
-d, --debug                 output debugging information
```

## Automating with NPM Scripts

Add to your package.json a script definition to match your file generation needs.
This way, you won't have to repeat the whole command along with the options.

### Example

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "resgen": "irgen -p android,ios"
  }
}
```

### Usage

```bash
npm run resgen
```

NPM will handle typing the full command for you, reducing the chances of errors.
